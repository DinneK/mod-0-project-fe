# Array Methods and What they do!

 - **Pop** The `pop()` method simply removes or takes away the last element in an array. It will change the length of the array by shortening it by one.

 - **Push** The `push()` method will add one element to the end of an array, it also adds length to an array.

 - **Shift** The `shift()` method takes away the first element of an array.

 - **Unshift** The `unshift()` method adds an element to the beginning of an array and changes the length.
