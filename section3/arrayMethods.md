# Array Methods and What they do!

 - **Pop** The `pop()` method simply removes or takes away the last element in an array. It will change the length of the array by shortening it by one. For example, if you have a stack of books, _pop_ will just take a book off the end of the stack and throw it away, shortening your stack.

 - **Push** The `push()` method will add one element to the end of an array, it also adds length to an array. To use the book example again, this will add to your stack of books and make it larger.

 - **Shift** The `shift()` method takes away the first element of an array and returns that element. Continuing with the stack of books example. _Shift_ will take the first book from a stack of books and hand that first book to the reader.

 - **Unshift** The `unshift()` method adds an element to the beginning of an array and changes the length. This method adds one more book to the very front of your book stack and makes that stack bigger.
