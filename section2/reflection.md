## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
* Two points of a Growth Mindset article and video that really resonated with me were, one, that you can learn anything, which is huge for me because I often talk myself out of learning something, telling myself that "it is just too daunting," that I'm not capable of learning something. Secondly, Making mental action notes and tracking your own progress is huge for me. These are powerful tools, to keep me from comparing myself to other and marring my own progress in learning a new skill.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
* I have learned to  break down tasks and projects into small parts, so that I can come at something as a complete beginner. Instead of beating myself up for not knowing something, I approach each piece with the thought "how do I learn about this?" As opposed to "Why don't I know this yet?"

* I still need to work on not stacking myself against others, it's detrimental to the learning process.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
* I felt okay about the process of receiving less support in the lesson, I feel like I'm starting to establish a strong support team with a few of my cohorts, my outside Turing development people, Slack and I'm starting to figure out efficient Google searches. It's been getting easier to ask questions. It also, made problem solving a little more fun, I felt like I was solving puzzles, they were fun to think about.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
* A conditional statement is a statement that evaluates to either true or false. If the first expression evaluates to true, the code stops running and prints the designated output. If, the first expression evaluates to false, the code keeps running on to the second expression. If, the second expression is true the code will stop running there and print what is in the console log of the second expression. The code will run like this through the statements until it finds a true or an else.

- A daily life condition that emulates a conditional statement, would be washing the dishes. If the dishes are clean, the condition is true and you can do something else, if the dishes are dirty, you have to wash them. When you wash the dishes, the dishes will be clean and you can do something else.

- Epicurious is a recipe website I love, when you go to the search bar, you are prompted to enter a recipe or food, if you do it will take you to the page with matches, else it prompts you to enter your search again.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
* You add multiple conditions to an `if` statement by using **If...Else**. If the condition of the first statement is met than the programs stops running, but if that statement evaluates to false, the program will keep running, to do this, you add an __else...if__ statement. If condition one is not met, else move on to condition two, if condition two is met, the code stops running, __else__, if condition two is not met, the computer moves on to condition three and so on.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
* The console in the browser, which is part of the Chrome DevTools, is an incredible tool. It allows you to play with around with code or check if two conditions are met. You can write the expression directly in the console to check your code.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
* I'm finding the logic of logical operators to be incredibly difficult. I think it may just be a thing that takes time. Thinking through the logic before writing the code is challenging.
